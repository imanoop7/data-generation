# Data Generation with Langchain

This repository is dedicated to generating synthetic data using Langchain, with the structure provided by Pydantic objects.

## Overview

Langchain is a powerful tool for generating synthetic data, which can be incredibly useful for testing, development, and machine learning purposes. By using Pydantic, we ensure that the generated data adheres to a predefined schema, providing structure and validation to our synthetic datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Langchain
- Pydantic
- any llm

## Notebook

`data-generation.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that contains all the necessary code and explanations for generating synthetic data using Langchain and Pydantic objects.

## Setup

To get started with generating synthetic data, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/data-generation/data-generation.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ``` bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the notebook


## Usage

The notebook will guide you through the process of setting up Langchain, defining Pydantic objects for structure, and generating synthetic data that fits your needs.
